## Share your announcement, news, or event information

Simply enter in a news announcement, information about an upcoming event, a thought, a question, or anything else that comes to mind. Some guidelines:

1. No profanity

2. The information can be gathered from other sources, but it must be entered in using your own words. Information should be verifiable.

3. Content will be reviewed and verified before it is published on the web

4. Include your name either above or below your entry in the document

5. You can discuss other entries by using the document's commenting feature.

If you want to reference news or an event but it is posted elsewhere, feel free to enter a description and then cite a URL or source.

Add your story or comment on an existing story [inside the Google Docs version of this publication.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zKEo2zGg3uzQTXMztq4bf8_SgdxE5QvqI-pedtTbik/edit?usp=sharing)
