## Just be Here Today

**By Jay Gross**

Hey There Life...And the lessons keep coming....I went to Sarah Elizabeth Kowalski's funeral yesterday... Watched. Listened. Even chatted a bit...Came away on the drive home with so many emotions... but one stood out...She lived. I mean she really lived well.Everything I saw from the standing room only attendance to hot conditions and not a single person leaving proved that...Donald Spachman, one of the very best, was at the helm and in control with a clear message...Sarah lived. She was kind. She was positive. She gave and in return she received...He tied in what her dad, Dave, had written along with what her brother, Josh Peters, also had written...And one thing stood out Life... Josh's and a quote..."Just be here today" (I'm pretty sure that's what it was, but the message is the same).... and echoed through me when I heard it...See Life, I forget this so often... I'm either looking ahead or reflecting on the past....I forget the now. And it slips by me.So caught up in what I have to do and get done that I have missed so many moments right now... opportunities to make memories, kind and positive memories, to reflect on later...Reflections like when I saw Billy Richards, Andrew Myers, Steve Bliven, and Josh and our old Morning Crew that used to lift together for years at 5 am four days a week... pushing each other, supporting each other, and spotting each other...Made me look around Life... because here was a community wrapped around a family and spotting for them when you got difficult for them Life...And it made the weight just a bit more bearable...And this was because of Sarah and how she lived... her kindness... her out look... her giving...Thank you for this reminder Life...I need to focus in the now... and be more like Sarah...She was one heck of a spotter...
