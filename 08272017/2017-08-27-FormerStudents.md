## Former Students

**By Jay Gross**

One of the very best parts of being a teacher for over 26 years in the same community...

Former students... running into them or, even better, them getting a hold of me to hang out with them at reunions or to watch something like the fight last night...

Well... it makes a crazy ole English teacher's heart warm...

Walking into the wedding and seeing [Troy Stressman](https://www.facebook.com/troy.stressman?fref=mentions), [Chad Cline](https://www.facebook.com/ccline2?fref=mentions), [Josh Ellis](https://www.facebook.com/Ellis.07?fref=mentions), [Justin Hyde](https://www.facebook.com/justin.hyde.12327?fref=mentions), and [Wesley Cole](https://www.facebook.com/wesley.cole.31?fref=mentions) was incredible... I always see them as those same ones sitting in my class... yet they have become grown men... out there attacking life... and succeeding!

And then [Michael Klumpp](https://www.facebook.com/michael.klumpp.75?fref=mentions) had gotten in touch with me, and I headed over to his house to watch the fight.

And oh ... the faces I saw... the stories that were shared... the 'trash talk' in the air... along with many smiles, laughter, hi-fives, and hugs...

Well... it was what makes this the greatest profession on Earth...
