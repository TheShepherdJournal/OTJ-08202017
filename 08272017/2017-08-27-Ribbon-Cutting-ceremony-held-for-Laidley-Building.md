## Ribbon Cutting ceremony held for Laidley Building

### ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/axhlfh44bQrknHLJ4fGrHw_img_0.jpg)

### When:

Friday, August 25, 2017

### What:

Several teachers, school board members, and administrators from both the Shepherd Public Schools and Mid Michigan Community College attended a dedication for the recently remodeled Laidley Building. SHS students who take dual-enrollment classes will attend classes inside the building.

The Laidley Building was built in the mid 1960's and was dedicated for retired Shepherd teacher Alda Laidley (1898-1991). Originally used as a fifth grade building, it has served many different purposes for the school district.

* 1980 - repurposed for use as a Central Office, Community Education and one classroom

* Late 80's - Central Office moved to its current location in downtown Shepherd, and Laidley was used as a fifth grade building until the new elementary school was build in 2010

* 2010 - 2017 - Used for different purposes including technology, pre-school and office space

### Why:

The goal was to reinforce the idea that students are taking college courses by taking them away from the hustle and bustle of the busy high school hallways. Also, recent changes to classrooms inside the high school had made it necessary to find more space for the college classes.
