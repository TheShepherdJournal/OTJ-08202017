## New Program Announced

"I know what is like to be a kid," the famous words that every adult has said to their children at some point...at least I have. But in reality...we have ZERO idea what is like to be a kid in this day and age. Times have changed.There are SO many things influencing our kids...good and bad. Last school year it became very obvious to me that we had to do something. WE (this community, our society) have to REFUSE to lose any of our kids to this junk the world is throwing at them.We developed a seminar for our middle school girls called SHINE - Diamonds in the Rough. Where did the name come from...I'm glad you asked. A diamond in it's rough shape looks like a plain old rock...nothing spectacular. To gain that shine, that glow it needs to be polished. Here is the interesting part, it needs to be polished very carefully. If it gets polished without care or too fast is will develop all types of cracks (if you are a gemologist...please give me a pass on the science, but I think I'm pretty close). Right now...society, television, internet, etc is polishing these rocks, our children, and they are cracking at an alarming rate. Our goal is to show the girls how they should be treated, how they should hold themselves to a high standard and remind them that they are in fact a DIAMOND! Initially this will be a seminar for each of the grades where our young ladies will hear from various successful women from our county and have a chance to ask them questions. School Counselor Julie Wright and I will also work on a follow-up strategy so this movement isn't just a one-time thing.These seminars hopefully will be happening this fall. We are also working on one for our young men as well. We picked this age because this is the time when their minds are developing from a child to a young adult.A HUGE thank you to the school, who was 100% behind this when I told them about this idea.I am just crazy enough to believe that we will have an impact on every one of those students and they will walk away UNDERSTANDING and BELIEVING that they are a SHINING DIAMOND!There will be more to come as we finalize the date.SHINE...SHINE...SHINE...SHINEChief Sawyer
