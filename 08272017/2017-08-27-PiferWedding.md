## Congratulations to the new Mr. & Mrs. Pifer

By Jay Gross

Hey There Life...Lesson learned...If you had told me earlier that being asked to perform the wedding ceremony for my former students would get me choked up, I would have smirked and said, 'Yeah right'...But I never could have imagined the look in Joe Pifer's eyes as he said his vows into Megan Cole's eyes...At one point I know I watched love pouring out...It was beautiful beyond words...Megan was a bride glowing in the moment... and Joe was so proud...Life... nothing could have prepared me for it...Experiencing it was amazing...Congratulations to the new Mr. & Mrs. Pifer!And life.... you be good to them!
