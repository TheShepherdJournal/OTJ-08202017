## Eclipse watchers and bloggers needed

Are you planning on observing the eclipse next week? The Shepherd Journal is looking for a few individuals who might be interested in safely sharing live video on Facebook prior and during the eclipse, or writing about the experience later.As we count down the days until the eclipse happens, I'm wondering what everyone thinks about it, who is going to watch it or and who isn't and, if you are planning on observing it have you made any special plans?

## Are you a TV or Movie fanatic?

The Shepherd Journal is looking for a few people who might be interested in writing stories about the entertainment industry, including movie reviews, TV commentaries, or just general pieces. If you are a fan of a specific popular movie or TV series and would like to share your passion with others, consider writing as an expert. For example, I would love to offer recurring articles about "The Walking Dead."

## The Shepherd Journal can help you promote your event or news

Social media as a whole has proven to a strong way to get your message out, but there is still no substitute for the focused, targeted coverage offered by a local newspaper. The Shepherd Journal can work with you to ensure that your message most effectively reaches as large of an audience as possible and makes the greatest impact.For more information, send email to editor@shepherdhistory.org or send a private message via Facebook.

## Enough is enough

By Shepherd Police Department

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Not the positive news you hope to wake up to. Thoughts and prayers to the families of these officers. While we may be sad, we may be angry, we may be hurt...WE WILL NOT GIVE UP! Men and women across this country will continue to protect and serve today, just like any other day...not because we are through hurting, but because we have a job to do and in doing that job we are honoring those heroes taken from us (sorry for that LLOONNGG run-on sentence).Hug your loved ones, don't sweat the small stuff and have some fun...because tomorrow is not promised.Chief Sawyer

## Women's Self Defense Seminar Information

By Shepherd Police Department

Hey everybody! Just a few reminders about our upcoming Women's Self Defense Seminar on October 28…

1. We don't have unlimited space, but do not want to turn anyone away. Spots are filling up already, so if you want to attend please send your name, age and telephone number to spd@villageofshepherd.org. Just liking or saying you'll attend on the EVENT PAGE does not register you. Payment will be given the day of the event.

2. Last year we did not allow 16 and 17 year olds to attend last year and have changed it for this year (they MUST be accompanied by an adult). We will not allow anyone younger to attend, for several reasons:

* This a very serious topic. While we don't want to "shelter" younger girls to it, some of techniques taught can be deadly force. We don't believe that 3 hours is enough time to convey the seriousness of them to a younger crowd.

* We are going to cram a lot of material into 3 hours and it may be too much to learn/remember for a younger mind. A weekly martial arts class would be perfect for them.

1. Come ready to have fun and learn.

We will have many more updates before the event, but these are some essential reminders.
