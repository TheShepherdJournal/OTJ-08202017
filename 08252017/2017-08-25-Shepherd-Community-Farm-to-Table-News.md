The Shepherd Community Farm to Table committee donated $1,000 to the St. Vincent De Paul Food Pantry on Wednesday, August 23. The proceeds were raised during the recent Farm to Table event which was held on the evening of August 10.

During the dinner,  guests dined in the middle of Second Street in Shepherd on a multi-course meal of locally harvested foods prepared by the Fireside Grille, Mitchell's Gourmet Deli and Market, Marrita’s, Shepherd Bar and Restaurant, Jenny’s Catering, and Cone 'n Candy.  They were also entertained by Celtic, maritime, and old-time music provided by the band Tinker’s Folly. The event also featured a silent auction and a drawing for door prizes donated by local businesses.

Committee organizer Chris Kutz described the dinner as an opportunity to celebrate the hard work of local farmers and their products while giving back to the community.

"Tonight, all of the proceeds from the Farm to Table Dinner and Silent Auction were given to the St. Vincent De Paul Food Pantry in Shepherd as a way to bring the farmers' bounty full circle to the tables of local residents," Kutz said.

Event organizers are planning a larger Shepherd Community Farm to Table Dinner for 2018. Interested parties are encouraged to keep an eye on the Facebook page of Shepherd Community Farm to Table Dinner.
