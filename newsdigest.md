# News Digest

## Are you a TV or Movie fanatic?

The Shepherd Journal is looking for a few people who might be interested in writing stories about the entertainment industry, including movie reviews, TV commentaries, or just general pieces. If you are a fan of a specific popular movie or TV series and would like to share your passion with others, consider writing as an expert. For example, I would love to offer recurring articles about "The Walking Dead."


## The Shepherd Journal can help you promote your event or news

Social media as a whole has proven to a strong way to get your message out, but there is still no substitute for the focused, targeted coverage offered by a local newspaper. The Shepherd Journal can work with you to ensure that your message most effectively reaches as large of an audience as possible and makes the greatest impact.For more information, send email to editor@shepherdhistory.org or send a private message via Facebook.
