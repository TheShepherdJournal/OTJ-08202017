## Enough is enough

By Shepherd Police Department

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Not the positive news you hope to wake up to. Thoughts and prayers to the families of these officers. While we may be sad, we may be angry, we may be hurt...WE WILL NOT GIVE UP! Men and women across this country will continue to protect and serve today, just like any other day...not because we are through hurting, but because we have a job to do and in doing that job we are honoring those heroes taken from us (sorry for that LLOONNGG run-on sentence).Hug your loved ones, don't sweat the small stuff and have some fun...because tomorrow is not promised.Chief Sawyer
