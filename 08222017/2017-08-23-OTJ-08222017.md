## Keep Joe Passalacqua's Mother in your thoughts

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/XFJKmONfbq4RfGoUcHr6vQ_img_0.png)

**By Jay Gross**

Hey There Shepherd...Not sure if you knew or not but we have had another misfortune to one of our Blue Jays...Our high school principal Joseph Passalacqua'a mom suffered a massive heart attack Sunday... he was with her since then...I just now received the following from Joe:

"Good evening staff,First, thank you all for the kind thoughts and comments.I heard that the first day went well.The prognosis for my mother is not promising. The doc indicated that they plan on having her there a minimum 5 days more in ICU just to try to get her stronger. They struggled to keep her stabilized through the day and night. There are no other talks of other treatments until they get her stronger.Earlier, my mom was alert and able to try to communicate. But she would get so weak and the machines would start going off. It seemed that she was there mentally but not strong enough physically.I have the wonderful assistance of siblings and family who will be able to oversee her stay at the hospital."

Any prayers/strength/thoughts for his Mom, for Joe, or for his family would be greatly appreciated...PS: That is her bottom left eating her birthday cake…

## Just be Here Today

**By Jay Gross**

Hey There Life...And the lessons keep coming....I went to Sarah Elizabeth Kowalski's funeral yesterday... Watched. Listened. Even chatted a bit...Came away on the drive home with so many emotions... but one stood out...She lived. I mean she really lived well.Everything I saw from the standing room only attendance to hot conditions and not a single person leaving proved that...Donald Spachman, one of the very best, was at the helm and in control with a clear message...Sarah lived. She was kind. She was positive. She gave and in return she received...He tied in what her dad, Dave, had written along with what her brother, Josh Peters, also had written...And one thing stood out Life... Josh's and a quote..."Just be here today" (I'm pretty sure that's what it was, but the message is the same).... and echoed through me when I heard it...See Life, I forget this so often... I'm either looking ahead or reflecting on the past....I forget the now. And it slips by me.So caught up in what I have to do and get done that I have missed so many moments right now... opportunities to make memories, kind and positive memories, to reflect on later...Reflections like when I saw Billy Richards, Andrew Myers, Steve Bliven, and Josh and our old Morning Crew that used to lift together for years at 5 am four days a week... pushing each other, supporting each other, and spotting each other...Made me look around Life... because here was a community wrapped around a family and spotting for them when you got difficult for them Life...And it made the weight just a bit more bearable...And this was because of Sarah and how she lived... her kindness... her out look... her giving...Thank you for this reminder Life...I need to focus in the now... and be more like Sarah...She was one heck of a spotter...

## Eclipse watchers and bloggers needed

Are you planning on observing the eclipse next week? The Shepherd Journal is looking for a few individuals who might be interested in safely sharing live video on Facebook prior and during the eclipse, or writing about the experience later.As we count down the days until the eclipse happens, I'm wondering what everyone thinks about it, who is going to watch it or and who isn't and, if you are planning on observing it have you made any special plans?

## * * *
Are you a TV or Movie fanatic?

The Shepherd Journal is looking for a few people who might be interested in writing stories about the entertainment industry, including movie reviews, TV commentaries, or just general pieces. If you are a fan of a specific popular movie or TV series and would like to share your passion with others, consider writing as an expert. For example, I would love to offer recurring articles about "The Walking Dead."

## Enough is enough

By Shepherd Police Department

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Not the positive news you hope to wake up to. Thoughts and prayers to the families of these officers. While we may be sad, we may be angry, we may be hurt...WE WILL NOT GIVE UP! Men and women across this country will continue to protect and serve today, just like any other day...not because we are through hurting, but because we have a job to do and in doing that job we are honoring those heroes taken from us (sorry for that LLOONNGG run-on sentence).Hug your loved ones, don't sweat the small stuff and have some fun...because tomorrow is not promised.Chief Sawyer

## Women's Self Defense Seminar Information

By Shepherd Police Department

Hey everybody! Just a few reminders about our upcoming Women's Self Defense Seminar on October 28…

1. We don't have unlimited space, but do not want to turn anyone away. Spots are filling up already, so if you want to attend please send your name, age and telephone number to spd@villageofshepherd.org. Just liking or saying you'll attend on the EVENT PAGE does not register you. Payment will be given the day of the event.

2. Last year we did not allow 16 and 17 year olds to attend last year and have changed it for this year (they MUST be accompanied by an adult). We will not allow anyone younger to attend, for several reasons:

* This a very serious topic. While we don't want to "shelter" younger girls to it, some of techniques taught can be deadly force. We don't believe that 3 hours is enough time to convey the seriousness of them to a younger crowd.

* We are going to cram a lot of material into 3 hours and it may be too much to learn/remember for a younger mind. A weekly martial arts class would be perfect for them.

1. Come ready to have fun and learn.

We will have many more updates before the event, but these are some essential reminders.
