Hey There Shepherd...

Not sure if you knew or not but we have had another misfortune to one of our Blue Jays...

Our high school principal Joseph Passalacqua'a mom suffered a massive heart attack Sunday... he was with her since then...

I just now received the following from Joe:

"Good evening staff,

First, thank you all for the kind thoughts and comments.

I heard that the first day went well.

The prognosis for my mother is not promising. The doc indicated that they plan on having her there a minimum 5 days more in ICU just to try to get her stronger. They struggled to keep her stabilized through the day and night. There are no other talks of other treatments until they get her stronger.

Earlier, my mom was alert and able to try to communicate. But she would get so weak and the machines would start going off. It seemed that she was there mentally but not strong enough physically.

I have the wonderful assistance of siblings and family who will be able to oversee her stay at the hospital."

Any prayers/strength/thoughts for his Mom, for Joe, or for his family would be greatly appreciated...

PS: That is her bottom left eating her birthday cakeâ€¦
