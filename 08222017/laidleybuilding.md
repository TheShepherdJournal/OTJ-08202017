Shepherd Public Schools & Mid Michigan Community College have donated their time and services to upgrade the facility and to equip the classrooms with necessary equipment to make the classrooms into full-functioning learning environments suitable for instruction. 

**About Laidley Building:**

The 4 room building will be repurposed as a mini satellite campus for the dual enrolled classes offered to Shepherd High School and Early College students. On this date they will celebrate their continued and strengthened partnership with MMCC. President Hammond from MMCC will be in attendance along with Superintendent Bunker and many others from Shepherd Public Schools (SPS) to commemorate this joint venture. They are continuing to enhance their dual enrollment offerings for the students of Shepherd High School and the select few who have enrolled in the Shepherd Early College program.
