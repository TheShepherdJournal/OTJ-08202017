## Women's Self Defense Seminar Information

**By Shepherd Police Department**

Hey everybody! Just a few reminders about our upcoming Women's Self Defense Seminar on October 28â€¦

1. We don't have unlimited space, but do not want to turn anyone away. Spots are filling up already, so if you want to attend please send your name, age and telephone number to spd@villageofshepherd.org. Just liking or saying you'll attend on the EVENT PAGE does not register you. Payment will be given the day of the event.

2. Last year we did not allow 16 and 17 year olds to attend last year and have changed it for this year (they MUST be accompanied by an adult). We will not allow anyone younger to attend, for several reasons:

* This a very serious topic. While we don't want to "shelter" younger girls to it, some of techniques taught can be deadly force. We don't believe that 3 hours is enough time to convey the seriousness of them to a younger crowd.

* We are going to cram a lot of material into 3 hours and it may be too much to learn/remember for a younger mind. A weekly martial arts class would be perfect for them.

1. Come ready to have fun and learn.

We will have many more updates before the event, but these are some essential reminders.
